## What technologies are involved?

- React-paginate
- React-query
- Formik and Yup
- Styled-components
- Axios
- Stripe API

Intially I hosted this with AWS, running on an EC2 Ubuntu instance.
This site was shortly removed by Amazon for obvious reasons.

I added a disclaimer to make it clear that this isn't a phising website, and
have also changed the logo around slightly.

I've moved the frontend to firebase and the backend to HeroKu.

## What's next for this project?

Now that V1.0 is fully complete, the focus for the next build will be to further centralise and improve error handling notifications within the state, have a loading spinner for longer tasks, categorising products into different categories, letting users search for products and be given search suggestions, and finally login by entering one-time-passcodes.

## Will you accept pull requests?

I'm always open to feedback on how to improve/expand my projects, however I’m not open to pull requests because this project is designed to demonstrate proficiency.
