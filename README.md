## What technologies are involved?

This frontend has a number of technologies involved, including:

- React

I've hosted the frontend with AWS, running on an EC2 Ubuntu instance.

## What's next for this project?

Now that V1.0 is fully complete, the focus for the next build will be to further centralise and improve error handling notifications within the state, have a loading spinner for longer tasks, categorising products into different categories, letting users search for products and be given search suggestions, and finally login by entering one-time-passcodes.

## Will you accept pull requests?

I'm always open to feedback on how to improve/expand my projects, however Iâ€™m not open to pull requests because this project is designed to demonstrate proficiency.
